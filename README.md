## CH<sub>3</sub>OH
We provide a step-wise procedure to train and test ML models for the prediction of overall reaction free energy barrier (ΔΔG<sup>‡M</sup>) (target property) for CH<sub>3</sub>OH formation mechanism from CO<sub>2</sub> using aromatic Mn-PNP catalyst. Codes of Cross_validation, permutation feature importance and parity plot for the best ML model are also provided.
