## CH3OH.ipynb
We provide a step-wise procedure to train and test ML models for the prediction of overall reaction free energy barrier (ΔΔG<sup>‡M</sup>) (target property) for CH<sub>3</sub>OH formation mechanism from CO<sub>2</sub> using aromatic Mn-PNP catalysts. Codes of Cross_validation, permutation feature importance and parity plot for the best ML model are also provided.

## Noyori.ipynb
We provide a step-wise procedure to train and test ML models for the prediction of overall reaction free energy barrier (ΔΔG<sup>‡N</sup>) (target property) of Noyori type mechanism for the HCOOH formation from CO<sub>2</sub> using aromatic Mn-PNP catalysts. Codes of Cross_validation, permutation feature importance and parity plot for the best ML model are also provided.

## Revised Noyori.ipynb
We provide a step-wise procedure to train and test ML models for the prediction of overall reaction free energy barrier (ΔΔG<sup>‡RN</sup>) (target property) of  revised Noyori type mechanism for the HCOOH formation from CO<sub>2</sub> using aromatic Mn-PNP catalyst. Codes of Cross_validation, permutation feature importance and parity plot for the best ML model are also provided.

## TS1.ipynb
We provide a step-wise procedure to train and test ML models for the prediction of activation energy barrier (ΔG<sup>‡</sup>) (target property) of transition state one (TS1) using aromatic Mn-PNP catalysts. Codes of Cross_validation, and parity plot for the best ML model are also provided.

## TS2.ipynb
We provide a step-wise procedure to train and test ML models for the prediction of activation energy barrier (ΔG<sup>‡</sup>) (target property) of transition state two (TS2) using aromatic Mn-PNP catalysts. Codes of Cross_validation, and parity plot for the best ML model are also provided.

## TS3.ipynb
We provide a step-wise procedure to train and test ML models for the prediction of activation energy barrier (ΔG<sup>‡</sup>) (target property) of transition state three (TS3) using aromatic Mn-PNP catalysts. Codes of Cross_validation, and parity plot for the best ML model are also provided.
